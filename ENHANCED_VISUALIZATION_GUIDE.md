- üü° **Yellow**: Vulnerable nodes (only 1 connection)
- üü† **Orange**: Highlighted/selected nodes

### **Node Sizes**
Node size indicates importance:
- **Base Size**: All nodes have minimum readable size
- **Connection Bonus**: +2 pixels per connection
- **Score Bonus**: +10 pixels per optimization score point

### **Edge Styles**
- **Thin Gray**: Normal connections
- **Thick Orange**: Critical path connections (when enabled)
- **Edge Opacity**: Based on connection quality/SNR

## üîç Advanced Features

### **Critical Path Detection**
Click "Find Critical Paths" to:
- Identify the most important connections in your network
- Highlight paths between high-importance nodes
- Show which connections are essential for network connectivity
- Help prioritize which nodes need the most attention

### **Filtering for Focus**
Use filters to reduce visual complexity:
- **Hide isolated nodes** when troubleshooting connectivity
- **Show only routers** to understand backbone structure  
- **Filter by connection count** to find over/under-connected nodes
- **Critical path mode** to see only essential connections

### **Layout Optimization**
Different algorithms work better for different scenarios:
- **Small networks (< 30 nodes)**: Spring Enhanced or Circular
- **Medium networks (30-100 nodes)**: Force Atlas or Community Based
- **Large networks (100+ nodes)**: Hierarchical or Community Based
- **Dense networks**: Edge Bundled to reduce clutter

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting Tips

### **Performance**
- For large networks (100+ nodes), use fewer iterations (50-100)
- Try Community Based or Hierarchical layouts for better performance
- Use filtering to reduce displayed nodes

### **Visual Clarity**
- Increase node separation if nodes overlap
- Try different layout algorithms if structure isn't clear
- Use critical path highlighting to focus on important connections
- Adjust label size based on zoom level

### **Network Analysis**
- Look for isolated (red) nodes that need connection
- Identify vulnerable (yellow) nodes that need redundancy
- Use critical path highlighting to find essential connections
- Check node details for poor SNR connections

## üì§ Export and Sharing

### **HTML Export**
The "Export HTML" feature creates a standalone file that:
- Contains all the interactivity of the main application
- Can be opened in any modern web browser
- Includes all current filter and layout settings
- Perfect for sharing analysis with others
- Works offline once saved

### **Best Practices for Export**
1. Set up your ideal view (layout, filters, highlights)
2. Click "Export HTML" 
3. Choose a descriptive filename
4. The file will automatically open in your browser
5. Share the HTML file with colleagues or documentation

## üéØ Use Cases

### **Network Planning**
- Use hierarchical layout to understand network topology
- Identify areas needing more routers (isolated client clusters)
- Find optimal router placement using critical path analysis

### **Troubleshooting**
- Filter to show only problematic nodes (isolated, vulnerable)
- Check connection quality through detailed tooltips
- Use critical path highlighting to prioritize fixes

### **Network Optimization**
- Identify redundant routers (low optimization scores)
- Find clients that should be promoted to routers
- Analyze connection quality and plan improvements

### **Documentation**
- Export HTML visualizations for network documentation
- Use different layouts for different audiences
- Include in reports and presentations

### Enhanced Click Interactivity

The network visualization now supports advanced click functionality that provides detailed insights into node connections:

#### Node Click Behavior
- **Single Click**: Click on any node to highlight it and all its connections
  - The clicked node turns **orange** to indicate selection
  - Connected nodes remain in their original colors and show labels
  - All other nodes are **dimmed** (gray, semi-transparent) to focus attention
  - Edges connected to the selected node are **highlighted in orange** with increased thickness
  - Other edges are dimmed to reduce visual clutter

#### Visual Feedback
- **Selected Node**: Highlighted in bright orange (#FF6F00)
- **Connected Nodes**: Retain original colors (blue for routers, green for clients, etc.)
- **Connected Node Labels**: Always visible when a node is selected, showing node IDs or names
- **Highlighted Edges**: Orange color with 3x thickness for edges connected to the selected node
- **Dimmed Elements**: Unconnected nodes and edges fade to gray with reduced opacity

#### Clearing Selection
- **Click Same Node**: Click the already-selected node to clear the selection
- **Double-Click Anywhere**: Double-click on the visualization to clear all highlighting
- **Clear Highlights Button**: Use the "Clear Highlights" button in the control panel

#### Benefits
- **Topology Understanding**: Quickly see which nodes are directly connected
- **Network Analysis**: Identify hub nodes and understand local connectivity patterns
- **Troubleshooting**: Focus on specific node neighborhoods for debugging
- **Performance Assessment**: Visualize the impact of individual nodes on network connectivity
